### Used Book Store Project

This project is a Full-Stack Website that uses the MERN Stack in its functionality.

The current design so far is a basic mockup with functional RESTful API endpoints designed using Express.js

Further Improvements will be coming to this website before deployment:
- Responsive, User-Friendly UI using ReactJS and Bootstrap
- Better Database Management using MongoDB to make storing and accessing data simpler
- Designing a scalable real-time chat feature for buyers and sellers to interact, using the Socket.IO library
